# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is the branch of Machine Learning where we deal with Labeled Data. A labeled data supervises the learning of a model by telling the model what answers to give under what circumstances, hence the name - Supervised Learning. In a labeled data we have both - a set of Independent Variables and a Dependent Variable. The dataset is divided into Training Data and Test Data. The model is built on the Training data, and then its performance is measured on the Test data.

## Regression
Regression is a statistical tool used for multivariate analysis. It is used to study the effect of some independent variables upon a target variable (dependent variable) that is numerical/ continuous in nature. Some of the techniques used to perform Regression are:
* Simple Linear Regression
* Multilinear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* kNN Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forst Regression

## Classification
Classification is a branch of Supervised Learning where we classify an event into a predefined category. Here, the dependent variable is always categorical/discrete. Some of the most widely used Classification algorithms are:
* k Nearest Neighbours (kNN)
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Kernel SVM
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
