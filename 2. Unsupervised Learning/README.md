# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the branch of Machine Learning where we deal with Unlabeled data. Since there is no dependent/target variable, there is no way to evaluate the correctness of the model. Unsupervised learning is used to cluster entities with similar behaviour. For example, Facebook uses clustering algorithms to find clusters of users that may know each other, and then uses that information to provide new friend suggestions within people of a cluster, since they have high propensity of knowing each other.

## Clustering Techniques
Some of the most widely used clustering techniques are:
* k-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
