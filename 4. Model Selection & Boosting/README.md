# Model Selection

This section will introduce you to concepts like Grid Search and k-Fold Cross Validation. These are techniques to improve the performance of the model we already built. 

**Grid Search** is used to choose amongst a list of potential values, the best combination as the hyper-parameter settings.

**k-Fold Cross Validation** is a better technique than a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
